### Hi, I'm Anthony 👋

I'm an Android developer with 7 years of experience creating native apps in Java and Kotlin, from scratch to publication.  
I’ve also worked with React Native and on backend development for some projects.  
Currently learning Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) to expand cross-platform skills.  
I love learning new technologies and finding better ways to build great products.
