Hi, I'm Anthony ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Android developer with 7 years of experience creating native apps in Java and Kotlin, from the first line of code to their release.  
Iâ€™ve also developed hybrid apps with React Native and worked on backend development for some projects.  
I love learning new technologies and finding better ways to build great products.
